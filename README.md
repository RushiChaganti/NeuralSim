  - Launch the ANN Simulator for interactive exploration.
- **Biological Neural Networks (BNNs):**

  - Simulate electric signal spikes, neuron signal transmission, synaptic connections, and dendrite interactions.
  - Launch the BNN Simulator for real-time simulations.
- **Brain Function Modules:**

  - Explore visual processing, audio processing, motor functions, and cognitive demonstrations.
  - Launch Brain Function simulations.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**

  - Interactive visualizations of algorithms like backpropagation, random forests, CNN architectures, and linear regression.
  - Launch ML Algorithm visualizations.
- **Learning Resources:**

  - Access educational content to deepen your understanding of neural networks and machine learning.
